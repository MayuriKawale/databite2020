## Tutorial 3: Text Analysis
Prepared by: Keerti Banweer

Textual data is unstructured and complex. Extracting meaniningful patterns and insigths from it cannot be achieved by directly using mathematical or statistical models. 
This tutorial will cover step by step approach to build a classification model to be able to classify complex text data. A typical workflow for a text
classification system is as follows:
    
    Train and test datasets
    Text Normalization 
    Feature Extraction
    Model Training
    Model Prediction

We will be using existing packages from Scikit-learn and Tensorflow to build a classfication model. 
The presentation for this tutorial includes detail information of text classification architecture. 

### Text Normalization
    Text normalization is used to convert unstructured and complex textual data into more structured and 
    numerical format to be able to use for machine learning algorithms 
   Using [spacy](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101) for tokenization, word entities, and word vectors
### Feature Extraction
    Bag of words
    TF-IDF
    Advanced word vectorization 
### Model Training
    Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes
    Support Vector Machines
### Sentiment analysis using Tensorflow Keras
    TensorFlow provides a preprocessed IMDB dataset which consists 50000 movie reviews. 
    The positive and negative reviews are equal in number. 
    This dataset contains preprocessed movie reviews in the form of sequence of integers.
